My graphs were not showing up at GitHub, nor at the TT file submission site.
Here is an nbviewer page, which rendered out my graphs nicely.

Made fixes to my first submission, based off of the Reviewer's suggestions. Aug. 13, 2024.

Ver 13 has "new data" , using a dataframe for the years 2012-2016 for the latter half
of my data analysis.

Ver 13 has a new Conclusion, as "new data" has given different results.

Ver 14 - All cells run with no kernal fail, before saving, and uploading to gitHub and TT.

Ver15 - There were many fixes that are somehow missing in this new version, and had to be redone. My Jupyter Notebook has been acting funky for a while. I may need to reinstall. So, although it must seem like I am ignoreing your notes, I am not. I noticed a few of my rev 5 notes missing in this version. I added those back in. I think I have fixed everything now.
